      This course presents International Monetary Economics theory and applies it towards gaining
      an understanding of recent events and current policy issues. The theory presented in this
      course covers a broad range of topics including exchange rate determination, monetary,
      and fiscal policy in an open economy, balance of payments crises, the choice of exchange
      rate systems, and international debt. The insights provided by these theoretical frameworks
      will enable us to discuss topics such as current account deficits and global financial
      imbalances, the Chinese exchange rate regime, proposed changes in the international
      financial architecture, the single currency in Europe, the Asian and Argentine financial
      crises, and the role of international factors on a nationâ€™s employment, wage, and economic
      performance.
