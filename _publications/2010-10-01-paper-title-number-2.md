  This paper investigates why entrepreneurs differ so widely in the hours they devote to their businesses and the corresponding variation in firm size and wealth. 
I study how differences in time allocation and preferences influence women's entry into entrepreneurship and subsequent business growth. Using data from the Current Population Survey and 2007 Survey of Business Owners, I show that married women with children engage in a higher proportion of non-market activities as compared to their single counterparts. This disparity in time allocation contributes to significant variations in economic outcomes, both across genders and within the female demographic. I develop a quantitative model that examines the effects of gender asymmetry in non-market activities on occupational choice and business performance, highlighting the complex relationship between gender, non-market activities, and entrepreneurial outcomes.
