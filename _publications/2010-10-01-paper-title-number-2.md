  This paper examines whether the lifetimes of consumer durables have declined over time and investigates the underlying drivers. Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), we document a shortening of appliance lifespans alongside falling relative prices. We develop and calibrate a quantitative model of household replacement decisions to decompose these trends into supply-side (technological depreciation, planned obsolescence) and demand-side (price and income effects) forces. Preliminary results suggest that both faster depreciation and declining relative prices contribute significantly to reduced durability, with technological changes accounting for roughly half of the decline in the share of older appliances.
