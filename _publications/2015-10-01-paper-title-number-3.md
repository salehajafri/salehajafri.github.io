  I document that entrepreneurial hours are highly dispersed, and that entrepreneurs who work fewer hours operate smaller and less capitalized businesses. I extend the standard entrepreneur-worker occupational choice model with collateral constraints to include heterogeneous preferences for leisure and complementarity between entrepreneurial hours and hired labor. The model reproduces observed correlation between hours, entrepreneurial size, and assets, and reveals that the welfare impact of credit expansion depends on how entrepreneurs value leisure. Ignoring heterogeneity in leisure preferences overstates average welfare gains by more than 20 percent.
