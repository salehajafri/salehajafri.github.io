  This paper investigates why entrepreneurs differ so widely in the hours they devote to their businesses and the corresponding variation in firm size and wealth. Using the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, I document three robust patterns: entrepreneurial hours are highly dispersed, longer hours are strongly associated with larger firms in terms of sales and employment, and short-hour entrepreneurs are typically asset-poor. I replicate these findings in complementary datasets and show that standard models based on productivity or financial frictions alone cannot account for them. To explain these patterns, I develop a structural model in which entrepreneurs choose both whether to enter and how many hours to work, with heterogeneity in both productivity and leisure preferences. Calibrated to match moments on hours, the model reproduces the observed dispersion in labor supply, the monotonic scaling of firm outcomes with hours, and the distribution of assets across hour groups. Counterfactual experiments reveal that relaxing borrowing constraints has modest effects, while heterogeneity in preferences and strong complementarity between entrepreneurial hours and hired labor are central to understanding entrepreneurial diversity. The results highlight the role of non-pecuniary motives in shaping business outcomes and provide a framework for analyzing how policies interact with both financial and behavioral drivers of entrepreneurship.
